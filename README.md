## How to run

You will need make for windows.

First, instal [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)

After, Then you open the console, and in the "c:" directory you copy as follows:

```console
copy c: \ MinGW \ bin \ mingw32-make.exe c: \ MinGW \ bin \ make.exe
```
Now, just run the make.exe command.

Done! You no longer need to delegate to your IDE a task of compiling your C ++ files! YaY!
